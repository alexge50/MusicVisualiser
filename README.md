# Music Visualiser  
## Description
This is a music visualiser, which has as input sound from an input device (currently supports only linux with pulseaudio, and uses `pulse` device). It shows the waveform, and spectogram(wip).
## Roadmap   
* Spectogram view - frequencies view
* Special effects applied on the boring image. 
* procedurally generating a background, based on the data from the sound.  
## Current status
